# Summary
<!-- A summary describing the high-level functionality and purpose of the software for a diverse, non-specialist audience. -->
The `mlfit` package provides well-known multi-level fitting and integerisation algorithms for creating synthetic data. 

# Statement of need
<!-- A Statement of Need section that clearly illustrates the research purpose of the software. -->

# `mlfit` package

``` r
install.packages("mlfit")
```

The package was designed to support pipe workflows. Here is an example of how a `mlfit` workflow can be established using the data from @ye2009methodology:

```{r}
library("mlfit")

```
